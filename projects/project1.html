					<h2>Secure Web Application Server with Docker Deployment</h2>
					<div>
					<h3>Objective of the Project:</h3>
							<p>The primary goal of this project was to develop a highly secure web application server, specifically tailored for PHP script execution. The server was designed to be deployed using Docker, ensuring both security and scalability. A key focus was on mitigating common web vulnerabilities such as SQL injections and path traversal, with an emphasis on handling web requests securely.</p>

							<h3>Skills Learned:</h3>

							<ul>
								<li>Mastery in Docker containerization and deployment techniques, ensuring a scalable and secure server environment.</li>
								<li>Advanced understanding and application of web security principles, particularly in parsing and handling HTTP requests.</li>
								<li>Proficiency in implementing security measures against common vulnerabilities like SQL injections and path traversal attacks.</li>
								<li>Enhanced skills in vulnerability testing and documentation, using tools like Selenium for automated testing.</li>
							<ul>

							<h3>Tools Used:</h3>

							<p>Docker: Used for containerizing the web application server, facilitating easy deployment and scalability.
							PHP: Selected for script execution within the web server environment.
							Selenium: Employed for automated vulnerability testing to ensure robust security.
							Various Security Tools: Utilized for mitigating risks such as SQL injections and path traversal vulnerabilities.</p>

							<h3>Steps:</h3>

							<p>Writing a Parser: Developed a parser for HTTP requests without using external libraries, focusing on understanding the structure of HTTP requests and ensuring their validation.
							Turning the Parser into a Server: Integrated the parser with networking and file access modules to create a functional HTTP server. Emphasis was on making the server accessible to a network and serving files securely.
							Adding Server-side Execution: Enhanced the server by enabling PHP scripting, ensuring dynamic content delivery. Special attention was given to correctly populating $_GET and $_POST arrays in PHP.
							Vulnerability Testing: Conducted rigorous tests using Selenium scripts to identify and mitigate any potential security vulnerabilities.
							Documentation: Methodically documented the entire development process, including the configuration and deployment steps, as well as the findings from the vulnerability tests.
							Deployment with Docker: Finalized the project by deploying the server using Docker, emphasizing on security and scalability in a containerized environment.</p>
